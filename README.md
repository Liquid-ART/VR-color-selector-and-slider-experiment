It's a fully clickable VR prototype. [You can download SteamVR build](https://github.com/Liquid-ART/VR-color-selector-and-slider-experiment/releases/tag/1.1.1). 
But it's an only prototype so there a few small bugs. 

Project files require these assets to work:
[Big Furniture Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/furniture/big-furniture-pack-7717),
[Interior Collection](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/interior/interior-collection-144505),
TextMesh PRO,
